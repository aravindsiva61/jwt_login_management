User Authentication and SSO Implementation Using JWT.

This application is a user authentication and management system built using Golang, SQLite, and JWT-based authentication. It allows users to register, log in, reset passwords, and provides an admin panel for managing users. Additionally, it implements Single Sign-On (SSO) with JWT, allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple parts of the system without logging in again.
